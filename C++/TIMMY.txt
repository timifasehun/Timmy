BASICS

Syntax: language

; (end of every line in C++)
python the semi colon is not needed

code > compiler, translate it into binary numbers 
COMPUTERS ARE DUMB
 all code in main function, normally use void main
\



first one always remember \

s#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
void main() 
{
	cout << "Hello World";
	system ("pause");
}




library: collection of functions thaat computer can use only if you include it

namespace is different kind of library,

c out is standard function
void main is  the function
variables; a box where you store data
types of variables
int- whole numbers only 
double- decimal point moreprecise
float- floating point, lessprecise
string- include the string library, array of characters
boolean- true or false, 1 or 0
char- a, b, etc, letter but also a letter representation of a number

initializing a variable 
type name = value 
to add string  #include <string>
\multiple in<< must be on different lines


if (condition)
{
do stuff
}
else(conditio)
{do stuff
}



if (condition)
{
do stuff
}
else if (condition)
{
do stuff
}

else (condition)
{
do stuff
}




Switch(variable)
case(condition)
{do stuff}
break;
case(condition2)
{do stuff}
break;
default
{stuff}
break




LOOPS
for 
while
do-while


for (inti=0; condition; i++)
{
do stuff
}




do
{stuff}
while(condition)


3 ways to input on array

for loop is the best way to put it in an array


type name [size]


int arr [5]

for A(int i=0; i<5; i++)


hard coding 
arr [index]
arr [0]
arr [1]
arr [2]
arr [3]
...

INITIALIZATION
int arr = {1,2,3,4,5};


FUNCTIONS
type  name (parameters)

double add(double x, double y)
{
	return x+ y;
}
for functions, you always have to use,. return

last function is void\ print sees out the parameter
void print (parameter)
{cout << param;
}void does not return , if it does not return it is void



Classes 


Class name 
{

};
must put semi colon after the brackets\
public and private are the two types of classes

type(any one but void)  get (np)
void is the type here set (np)


int set Age (int newAge)
{
return new age;
} 

void set age (int newAges)
{
	age = newAge;
}

if it was public it would be 
name, age =v something



Pointer

and symbol-& means address of something eg
int* x = &y
this means that x is pointing to the address of y

int x = address of y


* means points to
eg 
x = *y;
the value is pointing to x
so if y is 5, x becomes y


3 things that are key to being programmers \
1. DEBUGGING\
2. FORMATTING\
3. GOOGLE\S
FOR C++
1. PONTEERS



ARRAY
wehen you want to traverse an array, the best one to use is for loop
